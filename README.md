:page_facing_up: This is a movie booking project developed with **React language**. You can select one of the movies made available by the API, the session and time and the seats you want. In addition, other people can also book and, when that happens, seats are unavailable.

**1.** ***Select API Information***: You can select movie posters to see their respective available sessions and also select the session to see available seats in the selected session.

**4.** ***Sucess***: At the end you will be informed of all your choices, don't forget to print and enjoy your movie. :clapper:
